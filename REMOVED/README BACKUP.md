# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- Name: DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- Website: domai.dev
- Support: humans@domai.dev
- Technical: ai@domai.dev
- Purpose: Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation
1. System Information & Diagnostics
   - EtreCheck: System report generation
   - OnyX: System maintenance & configuration
   - Pareto Security: Basic security checks
   - KnockKnock: Launch item checker
   - BlockBlock: Installation monitor
   - XProCheck: Malware definitions
   - LockRattler: Security system checks
   - Silent Knight: Security update checks
   - DHS: Dylib vulnerabilities/hijack search
   - Signet: Signature verification
   - Taccy: Privacy permission checks
   - Murus: Packet firewall management
   - Apparency: File integrity
   - Lynis: System security audit
   - Zap (OWASP ZAP): vulnerabilities in webapps
   - Wireshark/TCPdump: Packet Sniffing
   - Rkhunter: Rootkit detector
   - Little Snitch: Network connections
   - Virustotal: Check IPs

2. Problems with Current Approach
   - Tools don't communicate with each other
   - Inconsistent interfaces
   - Overlapping functionality
   - Varying levels of maintenance
   - Different learning curves
   - No unified data view
   - CLI power hidden behind complexity
   - Time wasted on learning curve
   - Copying and Pasting between tools

### What CLI Can Actually Do
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
- "One dome to protect it all. One AI to find them. One alliance to bring them and in quarantine, bind them."
- Unified interface for all security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with accessibility of GUI
- Adaptive to user skill level

## Real Talk Section - Extended

### Why Everything's So Fragmented
1. Historical reasons:
   - Tools developed independently
   - Different developers solving specific problems
   - No standardization
   - Apple's changing security model

2. Technical reasons:
   - Different subsystems
   - Varying permission requirements
   - Complex integration needs
   - System update challenges

3. Market reasons:
   - Niche solutions
   - Different target users
   - Varying business models
   - Support limitations

### How We're Fixing This
1. Technical Integration:
   - Unified command framework
   - Consistent permission model
   - Centralized monitoring
   - Standardized data presentation

2. User Experience:
   - Single learning curve
   - Progressive feature revelation
   - Consistent interface
   - Contextual help

3. Security Approach:
   - Comprehensive protection
   - Intelligent monitoring
   - Proactive maintenance
   - Educational components

## Additional Technical Considerations

### CLI Integration
- Wrapper for complex commands
- Visual command builder
- Result interpretation
- Command learning system

### Permission Management

- Permission tracking
- Security impact awareness

### System Integration
- Kernel extension management
- System extension handling
- Network filter integration
- File system monitoring

[Previous content about future plans, etc. continues...]

## Final Thoughts
The Mac security/maintenance landscape is a mess of fragmented tools. Each one is powerful in its niche, but users shouldn't need 12 different apps to keep their system secure and maintained. DōmAI isn't just another tool - it's the unification and simplification of Mac system management.

Remember: The power of the command line with the accessibility of a modern interface, growing with the user's needs and abilities.

# DōmAI Practicability Analysis - A More Precise Approach
(With thanks to Joshua Zlotnick for the linguistic precision upgrade)

## Why Language Precision Matters
When building security tools, the difference between "practical" and "practicable" isn't just semantic - it's the difference between "yeah, we could do that" and "yes, this will actually work in the real world."

## Real-World Implementability Assessment

### What's Actually Practicable Now
1. User Interface & Education
   - Adaptive learning ✓
   - Multi-level documentation ✓
   - Achievement system ✓
   WHY: Direct user interaction, no deep system access needed

2. Basic Security Features
   - System monitoring ✓
   - Basic firewall management ✓
   - Update checking ✓
   WHY: Uses existing APIs, proven implementation paths

3. CLI Wrapping
   - Basic command simplification ✓
   - Result interpretation ✓
   - Learning system ✓
   WHY: Doesn't require special permissions

### What's Practicable With Work
1. System Integration
   - Network monitoring (needs proper approach)
   - Process tracking (within Apple's limits)
   - Security state management (requires careful design)
   WHY: Requires proper permissions but has implementation precedent

2. Advanced Features
   - Basic sandbox (within security model)
   - Packet analysis (user-level access)
   - Threat detection (based on accessible data)
   WHY: More complex but demonstrably implementable

### What Needs Innovation to Become Practicable
1. Deep Integration
   - Kernel-level features (needs creative solutions)
   - Full system access (requires new approaches)
   - Enterprise integration (needs business model)
   WHY: Current security model requires innovative approaches

## The "Actually Doable" Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediately Practicable)
- Basic monitoring
- User education
- Simple CLI wrapping
- Achievement system base
TIMELINE: 3-4 months
CONFIDENCE: High

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Practicable with Effort)
- Advanced monitoring
- Basic packet analysis
- Simple sandbox
- More CLI integration
TIMELINE: 4-6 months post Phase 1
CONFIDENCE: Medium-High

### Phase 3: Innovation (Requires Creative Solutions)
- Deep system integration
- Advanced AI features
- Full tool replacement
TIMELINE: 6-12 months post Phase 2
CONFIDENCE: Medium (needs innovation)

## The Bottom Line
Is DōmAI practicable? Yes, with proper phasing and respect for real-world constraints. We're not just theorizing - we're building something that can actually be implemented and used effectively in the real world.

### Key to Success
1. Start with what's immediately practicable
2. Build on proven successes
3. Innovate where necessary
4. Always prioritize real-world usability

Remember: We're not building castles in the air - we're building a security dome that actually works.

# DōmAI Security Alliance - Elevator Pitch 🏰

"Imagine if all your Mac security tools worked together perfectly, taught you as they protected you, and grew together with your expertise. That's DōmAI.

We've unified fragmented security tools into one intelligent system that adapts to your skill level - from beginner to security expert. It's like having a security mentor, guardian, and command center all in one.

Want to check network traffic? No more jumping between tcpdump and VirusTotal. Need to verify system security? No more running five different tools to get a half-global view. DōmAI handles it all, explaining what it's doing and why, in language that matches your expertise. And for those times when you just _feel_ like something is off with your system, but you don't know where to look? DōmAI is there, listening to your natural language input in realtime, and guiding you.

It's not just another security tool - it's your security alliance. Whether you're checking IP reputations, monitoring filesystem changes, or managing permissions or certificates, DōmAI makes it simple, educational, and... well, no not fun... but... not horrifyingly tedius?

The best part? It grows with you. Start by setting your knowledge level and as you gain cybersecurity know-how, more features unlock and before you know it, you're a security expert with pentesting power.

DōmAI: Where protection meets intelligence."
